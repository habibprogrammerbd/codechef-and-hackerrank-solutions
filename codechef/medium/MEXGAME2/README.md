## Problem

### MEX Game (Hard)

Alice and Bob are playing a game on an array $A$ of $N$ integers. Alice goes first.

On each of their turn, they choose some index $i$ such that $A_i > 0$, and replace it with $A_i - 1$.

Such a move is valid only if the MEX$^{\dagger}$ value of the entire array does not change. The player unable to make a valid move loses.

You are given an array $A$ of $N$ integers. Count the number of pairs of integers $(L, R)$ such that:

- $1 \le L \le R \le N$
- Alice wins the game on the subarray $[A_L, A_{L + 1}, \ldots, A_R]$

$^{\dagger}$ The MEX of an array is the minimal non-negative element not included in the array.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer $N$. The second line contains $N$ integers - $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the winner of the game.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^4$
- $1 \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $0 \le A_i \le 100$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.
### Sample 1:

Output

```

0 0 1 1
1

```

```

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  The subarrays $[0, 3]$, $[3, 0]$ and $[0, 3, 0]$ are winning for Alice. $[0]$ and $[3]$ are losing.
